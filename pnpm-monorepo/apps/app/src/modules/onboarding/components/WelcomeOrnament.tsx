/**
 * The small ship of the welcome banner, which launches towards the upper
 * right corner with a flame behind it.
 *
 * The drawing needs more than one tone, thus it carries fixed fills instead
 * of `currentColor`:
 * - `#e0f2fe` (sky 100) for the hull, which stays light on the dark surface;
 * - `#2dd4bf` (teal 400) for the window, `#38bdf8` (sky 400) for the fins,
 *   the teal and blue of the welcome surface;
 * - `#fbbf24` (amber 400) and `#fef3c7` (amber 100) for the flame and the
 *   stars, the warm accent of the welcome surface.
 *
 * The ship does not move: it stands next to the greeting, where a motion
 * would draw the eye away from that text all the time.
