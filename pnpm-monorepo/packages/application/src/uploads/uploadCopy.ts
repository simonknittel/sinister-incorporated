/**
 * Duplicates an upload: a new `Upload` row owned by the acting citizen plus a
 * copy of the stored object under the new row's id, which is the storage
 * key. The probed dimensions carry over — the bytes are identical, so
 * re-probing would only cost another round trip.
 *
 * Used where a reference would be wrong: an event created from a template
 * gets its own cover, so editing or deleting one never touches the other and
 * the upload manager accounts for both independently.
 *
 * The source key is always derived server-side from a row the caller already
 * resolved, never from user input. Runs on the caller's transaction so a
 * failed surrounding operation leaves no orphaned row; the object copy
 * itself cannot be rolled back, but an object without a row is exactly what
 * the nightly upload cleanup removes.
 *
 * @throws ConflictError when the host has no file storage
